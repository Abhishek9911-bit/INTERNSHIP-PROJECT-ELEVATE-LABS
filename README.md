# INTERNSHIP-PROJECT-ELEVATE-LABS
Password Strength Analyzer with Custom Wordlist Generator
Project Overview
This project implements a comprehensive Python-based cybersecurity tool suite focusing on password security analysis and attack simulation. The toolkit consists of two integrated components: a Password Strength Analyzer that evaluates password quality using entropy-based calculations, and a Custom Wordlist Generator that demonstrates how attackers create targeted password dictionaries for penetration testing.

Project Information
Project Title: Password Strength Analyzer with Custom Wordlist Generator

Student: S. Abhishek

Program: Cybersecurity Internship Project

Implementation: Python 3.13.9 on Windows

Project Objectives
The dual approach provides both defensive analysis capabilities and offensive security awareness, making it valuable for understanding real-world password attack vectors:

✅ Defensive Component: Analyze password strength using industry-standard metrics
✅ Offensive Component: Generate realistic attack dictionaries for penetration testing
✅ Educational Goal: Demonstrate password vulnerability concepts
✅ Practical Application: Bridge offensive and defensive security perspectives
